Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow
Handwritten digit recognition is a common image recognition task where computers recognize digits in handwritten images. Different from printed fonts, handwriting of different people have different styles and sizes, making it difficult for computers to recognize handwriting. This exercise uses deep learning and TensorFlow tools to train a model using MNIST datasets.
